# CDE School Rating Predictions
## Background 
The Colorado Department of Education (CDE) calculates performance ratings for K-12 schools at the end of every school year. The ratings fall in one of four categories:
1. Performance
2. Improvement
3. Priority Improvement
4. Turnaround

Priority Improvement and Turnaround schools recieve extra funding and supportive services from the state to improve the outcomes for their students. If, over the course of several years, the school fails to improve, then the state will take it over.

## Research Question
Can the rating category a school falls into be predicted based on district funding & setting, teacher salaries & turnover, and student demographics, trunacy & mobility rates?
